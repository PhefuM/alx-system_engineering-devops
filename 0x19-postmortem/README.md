# Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging - Load Balancer Outage 

## Issue Overview:

## Timeframe: January 19, 2024, 3:00 PM - 6:30 PM (South African Standard Time - SAST)
## Impact:
Users faced sporadic service disruptions with approximately 20% encountering sluggish response times and occasional errors due to a misconfigured load balancer.

### Root Cause: 
The uneven traffic distribution, resulting from a recent load balancer configuration update, was identified as the primary cause.

### Timeline:
3:00 PM: Automated monitoring triggered alerts for increased response times.
3:15 PM: Investigating engineer pinpointed uneven traffic distribution from the load balancer.
3:30 PM: Initial focus on backend server health metrics, with a mistaken emphasis on database performance.
4:00 PM: Escalation to the infrastructure team, shifting focus to load balancer configurations.
5:30 PM: Detection of a misconfiguration causing the load balancer to favor specific backend servers.
6:00 PM: Temporary resolution by adjusting traffic distribution.
6:30 PM: Confirmation of issue resolution as the load balancer resumed proper functionality.
# Root Cause and Resolution:

## Underlying Cause:
An algorithm flaw introduced during a recent load balancer configuration update led to uneven traffic distribution.

### Resolution: 
The issue was addressed by reverting the load balancer configuration to a stable version and implementing stricter validation for future changes.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:
## Areas for Improvement:
Strengthening change management procedures with comprehensive testing for load balancer configurations.
Augmenting monitoring capabilities to detect uneven traffic distribution and potential misconfigurations proactively.
Implementing automated testing for load balancer configurations before deployment.

# Tasks:
Post-incident review with the infrastructure team for in-depth analysis and identification of preventive measures.
Documentation updates on load balancer configurations for accuracy.
Scheduling training sessions for the operations team to promptly identify and address load balancer misconfigurations.
Exploring the feasibility of automated rollback mechanisms for critical infrastructure changes.

# Communication:
Regular updates were disseminated through internal channels, ensuring all relevant teams were kept informed of the ongoing investigation and resolution efforts.
This postmortem aims to illuminate the recent load balancer incident, detailing the timeline, root cause, resolution, and steps taken for future incident prevention. We appreciate the understanding and patience of our users during this period and remain dedicated to ongoing improvements for a more dependable service.
